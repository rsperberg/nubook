_An iPad e-reader based on Webkit, using RubyMotion_

What this is
------------
This is the repository for my investigation into building an iPad-only e-book reader, called NuBook.

In this initial commit, the nub01 project contains the files to build an iOS 6.1 project using RubyMotion for an iPad. The test file uses text from FeedBook's copy of Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse and treats the content as pages, and not scrolling.

By the roadmap, the version is right at milestone 0.1.
