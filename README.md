_An iPad e-reader based on Webkit, using RubyMotion_

What this is
------------
This is the repository for my investigation into building an iPad-only e-book reader, called NuBook.

In this initial commit, the nub01 project contains the files to build an iOS 6.1 app using RubyMotion for an iPad. The test file treats the content as pages, which don't scroll up or down, the way webpages do.

By the roadmap, the version is right at milestone 0.1.

Screenshots of version 0.1 are posted. They show the first two pages of _Siddhartha_ by Hermann Hesse, text used from the FeedBooks version (and Feedbook cover used to demonstrate graphics capability), and show CSS-coded page controls to navigate to the next and previous pages. (Code by Paul Craddock â€” see multicolumn-book-example for more information.)
