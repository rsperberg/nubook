Paged text in Webkit
====================
The examples here are modified from those appearing in Peter Craddock's tutorial on multi-page, multi-column web pages (http://www.arpia.be/2010/02/tutorial-multi-page-multi-column-web-pages/).

Since the Nubook e-reader is intended to run only on an iPad and makes use of Webkit (using UIWebView), code and css specific to IE and Opera has been stripped.

Craddock's example at http://www.arpia.be/sandbox/css3-book/#navtwo shows two different methods of paging (the two-book-examples file); I've stripped out everything connected to the first method, resulting in a file with just one example.

Craddock and others are understandably concerned with multi-column pages, but the initial work on NuBook orients the technique towards single-column pages.
